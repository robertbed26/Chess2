## Chess 2

*Kyler Carling (kjc472)
*Robert Bednarek (rab587)
*Skyler Hanson (swh65)

## Instructions

Control your queen using the arrow keys. Your goal is to eliminate the enemy king, while scoring bonus points
for any additional enemies taken out. Pieces do not move in their traditional ways, so consult the rules page
for full descriptions of their behavior. Your king will follow you wherever you go, and is vulnerable to 
attacks, while your queen is not.
